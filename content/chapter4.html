  Place one hand on your heart and feel the calming energy of the hand;

  </li>

  Observe your mind calming down, like ripples in a pond smoothening down;

<h3 id="healingmoves">2. Healing Moves</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
  Flowing from Chi Stance, move slowly and gently, with focused intention to clear up the blockages and move the blocked energy caused by any negative feelings affecting you;

  Movements are either rotating or flexing the joints, twisting and/or extending sections of the arms, legs, neck and spine or the entire body as a whole;
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    A simple example of this is as follows:
    <ol>
      <li>
      Begin from sitting or standing Chi Stance,
      </li>
      <li>
      Now lift your shoulders as far up as you can gently while inhaling and hold the breath and lift for a few second,
      </li>
      <li>
      Then, gently bring them down very slowly and synchronize the movement with the exhalation,
      </li>
      <li>
      Repeat for at least three times.
      </li>
      <li>
       Now sense how this magically transforms your tense and stressed condition to a positive and restful one.
      </li>
      <li>
      You can now refocus back to simply enjoying your Chi Stance and perhaps practice the Internal Smile, My Dream Me or the Heart Kungfu of Gratitude.

<ol>
  <li>
  Flowing from Chi Stance, stay focused and alert as you walk towards your destination;
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>

<ul>
  <li>
  Do the Inner Smile together with and to add chi power to all the other Chi Habits; but do the Chi Stance first:
  </li>
  <li>
  It is simply to invoke the smile from the joy in our heart and to expressed this joyful energy throughout our body; 
  </li>
  <li>
  To express this energy throughout the body, simple intend it or imagine feeling this energy of joy or elation radiating from our heart or inner core to every part of our body; 
  </li>
  <li>

  <li>
  Imagine a stressful situation from among those stated at the beginning until you can feel its negative Chi. Now recall any image or thought that would trigger you to smile.
  </li>

  See how the Chi of the internal smile neutralizes the negative energy.

<h3 id="heartkungfu">6. Heart Kung Fu </h3>

<p>
The training of one's heart in the disciplined tradition of Kungfu endows one to have inner toughness against debilitating negative emotions. From negative feeling, do any or all of the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
  In a journal writing mode (even just in your mind), describe the situation you are in as if you will report it to your "inner boss" or "higher self" or whoever you will want to have a meaningful conversation about it;
  </li>
  <li>
  This develops a clear understanding of your situation.
  This allows you to have a "handle on your feelings";
  </li>
  <li>
   Additionally, negative situations trigger our "complaining heart" -
  a chi-draining condition;
  </li>
  <li>
  Use this opportunity to develop a "Grateful and Forgiving Heart";
  </li>
  <li>
  These are powerful virtues that work together to open us up to external positive energy from other people and universal blessings, while at the same time unblocking the flow of Chi.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="waterdetox">7. Water Detox</h3>

<p>
Negative feelings are aggravated and triggered by fatigue/tiredness/low energy, poor blood circulation and toxins in the body.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
  Get a glass of water and assume the Chi Stance, Internal Smile and Heart Kungfu of Gratitude;
  </li>
  <li>
  Use this vibrantly positive energy to "bless" the water for 1 minute. Simply direct your positive feeling into the water;
  </li>
  <li>
  Drink down the water slowly. 
  </li>
  <li>
  Imagine how this water goes through your bloodstream and makes your blood more fluid-like so it can go through all the tiny capillaries and nourish and clean up the built-up toxins in your body.
  </li>
</ul>

  <li>
  Take a minute to do the chi stance unobstrusively while seated and have a Grateful Heart for the food before you slowly eat like a gourmet;

  <li>
  Bless the water and drink some to refresh yourself. Now, wouldn't you have a very delightful and energizing meal?
