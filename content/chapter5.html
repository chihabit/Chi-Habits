<p>
For the busy, modern warriors, the need to economize on time is top priority. Thus, first, we chose which to prioritize and how to sequence the rest of the habits for logical progression and synergy. And second, we make it fit within available time in one’s daily activities.
</p>

<p>
The 21-Day Chi program lays the foundational habits the Chi Stance and
Heart Kungfu of Journaling and Tai Chi Thinking.

<h3>First Habit to Focus on: CHI STANCE</h3>

<p>
Mother of the other Chi Habits Of the 8-Chi Habits, Chi Stance stands apart because each of the other habits has to include it. That is the reason why it is the first and an indispensable part of the first 21-Day Chi Habits Workbook Journal.
</p>

<p>
Following are the definition, objectives, benefits, step-by-step instructions on how to do the Chi Stance, how to establish your goals in terms of Time Commitment of when and for how long to do it in one’s daily life’s activities.
</p>

<h3>DEFINITION OF CHI STANCE</h3>

<p>
Chi Stance is the efficient way to hold the body’s posture, breathing and our emotions and our mind, which reflect in our body as we go through our daily life activities.
</p>

<h3>OBJECTIVES OF PRACTICE</h3>

<ul>
  <li>To obtain a balanced &amp; relaxed posture,</li>
  <li>To make the breathe deep, smooth, even and natural, and</li>
  <li>To calm and focus the mind.</li>
</ul>

<h3>BENEFITS</h3>

<p>
This exercise is simple and can be done anywhere to
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Detect our internal state and know if negative tension is building up towards a stress level which drain and pollutes our chi and</li>
  <li>Transform this inner state to one where we gather, circulate and purify Chi, and direct it efficiently to gain optimum performance in the activity at hand.</li>
</ul>

<h2>&#149; &#149; &#149; &#149; &#149;</h2>

<h3>STEPS IN DOING</h3>

<p>
Become aware of the following conditions:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Am I relaxed and balanced?</li>
  <li>Is my breathing in deep, smooth and even in my lower abdomen?</li>
  <li>Are my mind and emotions calm and focused?</li>
</ul>

<p>
If not, know that you are unnecessarily depleting your energy, and secreting toxins into your blood stream while radiating disharmonious energy. Slow down and make the following adjustments.
</p>

<h3>3 Chi Stance Adjustments:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    First, adjust the Body:
    <ul>
      <li>Imagine balancing a jug of water/books on your head,</li>
      <li>Sense the weight of every part of your body underneath, relax and release tension;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Second, Adjust the Breath:
    <ul>
      <li>Put one hand on the lower abdomen below the navel;</li>
      <li>Sense with your hands breath frees up as your abdomen release their tension;</li>
      <li>Effortlessly let the breath be calm, deep, long, smooth, even and silent.</li>
  </li>
  <li>
    Third, Adjust your Mind and Emotion
    <ul>
      <li>Put the other hand on your chest and sense as emotions calm down;</li>
      <li>The previous adjustments will automatically soothe the nerves and focus the mind.</li>
      <li>If in a panic state, sense and count your breaths and all will naturally begin to adjust.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<ol>
  <li>Maintain these adjustments as you go back to your daily activities while constantly readjusting.</li>
  <li>Do often/always so it becomes a habit and your default (natural) state of being.</li>
  <li>If you feel the pain and discomfort is overwhelmingly strong, flow into one, some or all of the other 7 Chi Habits you experienced in the last chapter.</li>
</ol>

<h3>TIME COMMITMENT <br/> AS GOALS FOR CHI STANCE:</h3>

When to Do?
While doable at numerous times a day, it is best to make the commitment at specific periods such as

Upon awakening
(will set the day to a good start) •

Before going to sleep
(will make the sleep more restful) •

Before eating 
(will improve digestion and nutrient absorption)

 During stressful moments
(traffic, meetings, meeting deadlines, stressful conversations)

<h2>&#149; &#149; &#149; &#149; &#149;</h2>

For how long each time?
Just set a minimum like 1 minute for each period, but know that you can do depending on the time available to you.

Test it out:

Reading, reflecting, trying out and playing around with the idea of the Chi Stances are allotted time along with the other learning preparations within 9 days before Day 1 of the committed 21- consecutive days of doing.
Time Commitment naturally flows from clear un- derstanding of what has to be done, when and for how many minutes.

(See next Chapter: Setting Time Commitment Goals).

Second Habit to Focus on:
HEART KUNGFU OF JOURNALING
&amp; TAI CHI THINKING 
Winning the 21-day battle with your heart

<h2>&#149; &#149; &#149; &#149; &#149;</h2> 

As a wellness warrior, one is imbued with a sense of mission – starting with one’s self and extending to one’s family, friends and beyond. Realistically, it is difficult to conjecture if we are winning the war on lifestyle illnesses, despite advances in modern medical science and billions of dollars spent on research and education to win this war.
Thus, when no solutions are in sight, we fall back on forgotten wisdom found in ancient cryptic classics.

Heart Kungfu are practices designed to provide one with inner discipline, wisdom, skills and powers to meaningfully deal with life. The first 21-Days will go beyond the basics of Grateful Heart and Forgiving Heart without ignoring them. We focus on the Habits of Journaling &amp; Tai Chi Thinking, to successfully traverse our 21 day challenge.

<h2>&#149; &#149; &#149; &#149; &#149;</h2> 

The Habit of Journaling
– makes possible the setting aside of time to deeply reflect with our heart on the days as they transpire. Journaling is needed for continuation and flow, the learning experiences of one day leading to increased understanding on the following day, with benefits accruing cumulatively. With journaling, our experience of the 21 Days would be many times more deep and meaningful.

<h2>&#149; &#149; &#149; &#149; &#149;</h2> 

The Habit of Tai Chi Thinking

– This quaint martial thinking empowers us to make a fun game of the events, situations and forces at work during the 21-days, while it simultaneously teaches us the profound concepts of this
“Grand Ultimate Martial Art”. The hurdles to complete the 21-Days are contrived as situations of battles with an unseen enemy – the legendary ninja, ultimate masters of the dark.

<h2>&#149; &#149; &#149; &#149; &#149;</h2> 


DEFINITIONS

Journaling and Tai Chi Thinking are used in tandem in the preparations and implementation of the 21-Day Chi Habit.

Journaling – is the art of reflecting and keeping
diary. This is the daily recording of our intentions, reflections, experiences, discoveries and learning.

Tai Chi Thinking – is the unique way of seeing situations from the framework of how Tai Chi as a martial art can “defeat a thousand pounds of force with just eight ounces.” This involves the learning of concepts from the Tai Chi Classics and its application in daily life in general and the successful completion of the 21-Days in particular.


<h2>&#149; &#149; &#149; &#149; &#149;</h2> 

OBJECTIVES

Journaling
Gain discipline to main-tain a commiment; 
Gain ability to self- reflect and articulate one’s feelings and 
understanding in writing.

Tai Chi Thinking
 Gain the facility of using a game framework to clearly see how the 21-Days can be played as a winnable game; Gain the practical understanding of key Tai Chi concepts and to practice applying it in daily life to complete the 21 Days.


<h2>&#149; &#149; &#149; &#149; &#149;</h2> 


STEPS IN DOING: Journaling Process
1) Set aside a minimum of 30 minutes to be divided into 3 periods of 10 minutes each, say 1 before sleeping, one each during coffee and lunch breaks.

2) Have writing implements constantly available, the Journal Notes and a pen or pencil.

3) During the day, have a constant intention to “see” what’s going on outside and inside you and mentally note them down. It would help if you assume the Chi Stance.

4) When writing time comes, just write without concern for “correctness”. Just download spontaneously an unedited draft within your available time. Being a perfectionist will take more time than you can regularly sustain.

5) Before your final journaling time at night, review your day’s notes and organize them for your final entry before you sleep. Use pencil so you can edit it later, if you wish.

<h2>&#149; &#149; &#149; &#149; &#149;</h2> 

BENEFITS
These exercises are simple and can be done anywhere to:

1) Gain the wisdom from knowing oneself and the nature of forces that prevents one from attaining one’s goals;

2) Learn techniques
from Tai Chi to overcome problems that hinder us from winning our daily life battles.

<h2>&#149; &#149; &#149; &#149; &#149;</h2>

STEPS IN DOING: Taichi Thinking Process
A.Think in terms of martial games

1) 21-Day war 
2) Daily battles and hourly skirmishes 
3) Enemy identification 
4) Strength and weaknesses of your own forces and of the enemy
5) Opportunities and threats 
6) Strategy &amp; counter strategy 
7) Winning, losing and learning 
8) Training 
9) Resources 
10) Timing

<h2>&#149; &#149; &#149; &#149; &#149;</h2>

B. Identify situations, conditions, events that would stop you from fulfilling your commitment goals

For example:
1) Waking up late
2) Too tired to do anything before sleeping 
3) A mind too preoccupied with problems and concerns at work or at home
4) Not in the mood to do this project

C. Reframe the situation as a martial game and play it as a win and/or to learn event:
1) Each commitment period which you have to fulfill is a battle if you encounter resistance;

2)The enemy is the force you have to contend with and neutralize; r ecognize and acknowledge the enemy to be within you as well;

3) Can’t comply with your commitment? You lose!

<h2>&#149; &#149; &#149; &#149; &#149;</h2>

For how long each time?

1) Just set a minimum like 30 minutes for actual writing, which you can divide up to 3 periods of 10 minutes at different parts of the day. It is helpful to do the last part of the writing before you sleep to give a closure to your day activities. it would also help you sleep better.

2) For the reflection and jotting down of random notes, this can be as little as 1 minute to as long as you like as when commuting long distances

<h2>&#149; &#149; &#149; &#149; &#149;</h2>

Note: Learn and use Tai Chi concepts to win.
(Read – Embrace the Tiger and Return to the Mountain in the next Chapter)

How to Score the Game: Winning, Losing &amp; Learning You lose,
but the loss may be investment or not:

0 pt = It is total loss if you did not learn from
it and may have even lost your fighting spirit;

1 pt = You win because there is practically no resistance, there is little or no learning here;

2 pts = It is an investment if you understood why you lost and had gained wisdom from your struggle against an overwhelming force. This is better than winning without learning. Your spirit is high as you are more ready for future battles.

3 pts =You win despite of an overwhelming resistance. You could have lost,
but eventually you won only after a long or difficult manoeuvrings. There
is great learning and experience here;

<h2>&#149; &#149; &#149; &#149; &#149;</h2>

TIME COMMITMENT AS GOALS:
When to do:

While this can be done at numerous times in a day, it is best to make Journaling as well as Tai Chi Thinking commitment at specific periods such as -

1) Upon awakening or better even before rising, putting your intention on how best to go through the day

2) Before going to sleep, would be the best time to organize your notes and put them down on your Chi Journal.

3) During work breaks

4) You can do reflection and short notes while: - Commuting or while driving through heavy traffic -While doing Chi Stances.
