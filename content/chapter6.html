<h3>The Culmination Of All Preparations</h3>

<p>
The past days of learning and trying out are all preparations towards arriving at this point when we are mentally and emotionally prepared to make a commitment.
</p>

<h3> Why is it important?</h3>

<p>
A commitment has the value of our word of honour. We need to honour our word if we want to have credibility not only to others but most importantly to our selves. Given this, we need to be wise and brave. We need to "know ourselves and know our enemy (forces that would prevent us from keeping our commitment)". We need to be brave likewise to make a daring commitment as a warrior because that is what we are "the fighters for wellbeing".

<h3>What is the time commitment goal?</h3>

<p>
These are simply the output of learning, reflecting and trying out the practices for a couple of days and coming to a conclusion in terms of just two aspects:
</p>

<p>
First is "When" are the opportunities during the day which you have decided as practice periods on a work day, on a Saturday, or a Sunday and on a holiday if it falls on one.
</p>

<p>
Second is "For How Many Minutes" will you practice for each.
</p>

<h2>&#149; &#149; &#149; &#149; &#149;</h2>

<p>
Reflections while doing commitment goals I think it is best to start the day with very clear plan and positive intention.
</p>

<h3>Commitment 1,<br/>Upon Awakening - Lying Chi Stance:</h3>

<p>
Even before I open my eyes to wake-up, I would do the lying down Chi Stance for at least a minute - gently bringing the images and feelings from sleep into awareness. I believe this is a healthy way to relate to my "yin" subconscious side. Then I would flow to my next goal. 
<br/>
<i>(Time: 1 minute or more)</i>
</p>

<h2>&#149; &#149; &#149; &#149; &#149;</h2>

<h3>Commitment 2,
<br/>Upon Awakening Sitting Chi Stance:</h3>

<p>
From lying down I would immediately flow to sitting Chi Stance and fully awaken into Tai Chi Thinking, I would imagine the things I will do during the day, particularly what the rest of my commitment goals for the day.
<br/>
This intention will lead my Chi to flow through my tasks and chores.
<br/>
<i>(Time: Workday 3 minute/ Non-Working day 6 minutes)</i>
</p>

<h2>&#149; &#149; &#149; &#149; &#149;</h2>

<h3>Commitment 3, 
<br/>Sitting Chi Stance in the Toilet:</h3>

<p>
This is a great time to continue Chi Stance, but this time, I would just simply focus on my relaxation and having a balanced and upright spine, neck and head. I sometimes put a book on my head. I find this time very beneficial as this allows me to reconnect with my body. I find this also very enjoy- able to just simply be in this state of physical and mental harmony. I also do Water Detox at this time, downing 3-4 glasses of water.
<br/>
<i>(Time: 5-10 minutes)</i>
</p>

<h2>&#149; &#149; &#149; &#149; &#149;</h2>

<h3>Commitment 4,
<br/>Standing Chi Stance in the Shower:</h3>

<p>
This is my daily spa, simply standing underneath the shower and imagining myself under a waterfall in a pristine forest. 
<br/>
<i>(Time 1 minute only to save precious water)</i>
</p>

<h2>&#149; &#149; &#149; &#149; &#149;</h2>

<h3>Commitment 5, 
<br/>Postural Stance with Kung Food at Meal times:</h3>

<p>
Breakfast is an important meal and not the time for hurrying up to work. When in a hurry, I just wrap my breakfast for the office. With all my meals, I commit to be in the balanced and relax posture and pleasantly enjoying my food, savouring slowly like a gourmet. 
<br/>
<i>(Time: through period to finish meal, say 10 minutes x 3 meals or 30 minutes total)</i>
</p>

<p>
You get the idea. Enjoy this journey of completing your goals!
