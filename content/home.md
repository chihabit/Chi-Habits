## Preface

Humanity is challenged by what the World Health Organization (WHO) predicts by 2017, an epidemic of chronic life style illnesses – heart disease, hypertension, diabetes and obesity to mention a few.

These illnesses can be prevented by managing one’s lifestyle with exercise, stress reduction and diet modification. However, solutions are stifled by a lifestyle burdened by time constraints, motivation and clear knowledge of what can be done.

## Why I wrote the book

This book centers on Chi or life energy. It talks to busy people who have affinity for Tai Chi and Qigong and an inner resonance with being a Warrior for Well-Being.

As a Tai Chi and Qigong practitioner and teacher for more than three decades, I have an intimate access to these practices that Time magazine has termed the ‘perfect exercise’. As a wellness practice, I believe this discipline has wisdom and tools that the world needs. This book is written primarily to provide modern busy people ready access to these nuggets and jewels of wisdom which are prized legacies from a long lineage of sages in China. Secondarily, it is my hope that this practice becomes an integral part of the reader’s daily life - as the daily brushing of one’s teeth. Only then can permanent and long term benefits be retained and lifestyle illnesses be averted or at the very least alleviated.
