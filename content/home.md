# Preface

Humanity is challenged by what the World Health Organization (WHO) predicts by 2017, an epidemic of chronic life style illnesses – heart disease, hypertension, diabetes and obesity to mention a few.

These illnesses can be prevented by managing one’s lifestyle with exercise, stress reduction and diet modification. However, solutions are stifled by a lifestyle burdened by time constraints, motivation and clear knowledge of what can be done.
