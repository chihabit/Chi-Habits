<h3>preface </h3>

<p>
Humanity is challenged by what the World Health Organization (WHO) predict by 2017, an epidemic of chronic life style illnesses - heart disease, hypertension, diabetes and obesity to mention a few.
</p>

<p>
These illnesses can be prevented by managing one's lifestyle with exercise stress reduction and diet modification. However, solutions are stifled by a lifestyle burdened by time constraints, motivation and clear knowledge of what can be done.

<h3>Why I wrote the book </h3>

<p>
This book centers on Chi or life energy. It talks to busy people who have affinity for Tai Chi and Qigong and an inner resonance with being a Warrior for Wellbeing.
</p>
    
<p>
As a Tai Chi and Qigong practitioner and teacher for more than three decades, I have an intimate access to these practices that Time magazine has termed the 'perfect exercise'. As a wellness practice, I believe this discipline has wisdom and tools that the world needs. This book is written primarily to provide modern busy people ready access to these nuggets and jewels of wisdom which are prized legacies from a long lineage of sages in China. Secondarily, it is my hope that this practice becomes an integral part of the reader's daily life - as the daily brushing of one's teeth. Only then can permanent and long term benefits be retained and lifestyle illnesses be averted or at the very least alleviated.

CHI HABITS An Inner Wellness Compass, Map and Rudder> 

Imagine a compass which tells you at any given moment if you are headed in a direction that drains and wastes your life force and ends in illness. The same compass will also indicate if you are walking the right path towards well being and peak performance level. Now, imagine also having the power to steer off the wrong path and to maintain your correct direction towards gathering and accumulating the energy. That would lead towards healing, rejuvenation, longevity and peak performance . And imagine this happens automatically.

A Compass, A Map and a Rudder – all after only 9 days of preparation and 21 days of practice on your convenient and available “downtime” in your everyday activities.

On top of this you would have gained improvements on your health – more emotional calmness, physi- cal relaxation and oxygenation of blood, improved posture and mental focus; and

Thirty days is short and will be over before one realizes it. But, within that time, you can obtain major health improvements and overall fitness as well as acquire productive habits that will eventually help you attainment of your life dreams.

Note:

Life force is Chi. The energy that circulate in and through our bodies. This power to steer towards gathering and accumulating energy is the art and craft of Qigong.
